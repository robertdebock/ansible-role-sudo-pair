Example Playbook
----------------

This example is taken from `molecule/resources/playbook.yml`:
```yaml
---
- name: Converge
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.sudo-pair
```

The machine you are running this on, may need to be prepared.
```yaml
---
- name: Prepare
  hosts: all
  become: yes

  roles:
    - robertdebock.bootstrap
    - robertdebock.core_dependencies
    - robertdebock.buildtools
    - robertdebock.cargo
    - robertdebock.git
```

This role has been tested on these [container images](https://hub.docker.com/):

|container|tag|allow_failures|

The indicator '\~=' means [compatible with](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/#compatible-release). For example 'ansible\~=2.8' would pick the latest ansible-2.8, for example ansible-2.8.6.

Exceptions
----------

Some variarations of the build matrix do not work. These are the variations and reasons why the build won't work:

| variation                 | reason                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Alpine | cannot produce cdylib for `sudo_pair v0.11.1 (/tmp/sudo_pair-sudo_pair-v0.11.1/sudo_pair)` as the target `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` does not support these crate types |
